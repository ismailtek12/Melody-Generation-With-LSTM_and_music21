# Melody-Generation-With-LSTM_and_music21
In this project, I tried to produce melody using folk music recordings with LSTM, which is a deep learning model.
I used the library called music21 to convert the melody into a format that can be put into the algorithm. You can find information about this library from the link below.

The construction scheme of the project is as the picture below.
